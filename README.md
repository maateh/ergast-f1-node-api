The original [Ergast F1 API](https://github.com/jcnewell/ergast-f1-api) has been deprecated and I wanted to create an alternative API for personal usage.

It's built in Node.js and uses Express for routing and middlewares.
Unfortunately, this project has never been completely finished because I stopped working [on my other project](https://github.com/maateh/f1-tracker) for which this API should have been required.
